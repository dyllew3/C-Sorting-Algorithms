# C-Sorting-Algorithms
Implements various sorting algorithms in C with integer arrays
This also gives Big O time complexity and space complexity for these algorithms
This currently implements the folowing sorting methods:
+ Heap sort
+ Quick sort
+ Merge sort
+ Radix sort
+ Insertion sort
+ Selection sort
+ Count sort

Shell sort is not currently implemented but will be 
It also has the methods sift down and heapify for heap sort. 
Radix uses count sort and uses base 10.The method swap, swaps 2 elements at i and j.
